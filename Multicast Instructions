Use multicast to transmit host ip address under linux.

Listeners
  $ nc -lu -W 1 7401

Multicast sender
  $ echo $(hostname -I) | nc -u -q 1 224.0.0.1 7401

Notes:
  "-W 1" on the listener makes nc exit after receiving 1 packet
  "-q 1" on the sender makes nc exit 1 sec. after its transmission
  "224.0.0.1" is the general multicast IPv4 address
